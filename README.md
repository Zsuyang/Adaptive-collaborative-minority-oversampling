# Adaptive-collaborative-minority-oversampling
Adaptive Collaborative Minority Oversampling for Multi-Class Imbalanced Classification
This repository contains the initial implementation code and preprocessed datasets (using 5Ã—5 cross-validation partitioning). Due to dataset size constraints, files are provided in compressed format.

Usage Instructions:
Download Resources:
Obtain TestData.zip containing all datasets and code

Execute Processing:
For each dataset in TestData:

Run 1_smoteboost_imp2.py

Then execute test0_sb10com2.py

Access Results:
Outputs will be generated in the Comparison directory

Note: Optimized code will be released following further refinement.
